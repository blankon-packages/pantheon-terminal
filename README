Pantheon Terminal (referred to simply as "Terminal" when installed) is a super lightweight, beautiful, and simple terminal.

It's designed to be setup with sane defaults and little to no configuration. It's just a terminal, nothing more, nothing less.

Pantheon Terminal implements process completion notifications.
They are enabled for BASH automatically. To enable them for ZSH, add the following line to .zshrc:
 builtin . /usr/share/pantheon-terminal/enable-zsh-completion-notifications || builtin true

DISTRIBUTORS: depending on the policy of your distribution, either inform the user about this via the default mechanism for your distribution (for DIY distros like Arch), or add that line to /etc/zshrc automatically on installation (for preconfigured distros like Ubuntu).
